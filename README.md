UX considerations indicated thet the most important functionality is the access to the radio stream and this is implemented on the home page of this application. This page consists of two features which allow the user to do this in easy and unobstructed way.

This section also includes a secondary CTA button which gets the user to the below section of the home page with additional methods of accessing the radio.
- Below the fold section lists available mobile applications whith which the radio can be listened to.

## **UX Considerations**  
The following decisions were made after considering the UX aspect of the website in accordance with 5 Planes of UX:
1. **Strategy Plane**  
The purpose of the website/application is to give acces to a live streamed internet radio to it's target audience. The profile of the radio is an emigration oriented and the main purpose is to give access to people all other the world living in different time zones. The contents of the radio programming is outside of the scope of this website but **Scope Plane** lists features which make some of these goals possible.
2. **Scope Plane**  
The basic features which need to be implemented to achieve the MVP are as follows:
- Creation of navigation bar to allow access to different website functions
- Easy access to the radio live stream
- List of radio programmes shedule
- Allow listeners to contact the radio
Extended features to implement are:
- Give acces to past programmes to allow listeners from different time zones to listen at time convenient to them
- Showcase authors and stuff profiles, with photos in order to create better connection with listeners
- Feture to allow posting comments/testimonies to create the *alive and connected* vibe
3. **Structure Plane**
- The most important feature is the 'listen live' function, this is implemented on the Home Page
- The 'Programming' information is less importand and is the secondary information, presented on a separate page.
- The third order of importance is the 'Contact' form, presented on another separate page.
4. **Sceleton Plane**  
*To follow but closely related to the above*
5. **Surface Plane**  
*To follow. Modern, clean and unclutered design with minimal distraction is preffered. Contrary to current trend, the background should be rather dark than ligh. This is more important on mobile devices so maybe change background to dark only for small screens*
